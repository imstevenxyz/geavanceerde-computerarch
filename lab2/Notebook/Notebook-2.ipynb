    "Last time we looked at how to write a kernel and what the performance benefits of using a GPU over a CPU are. For both the test code and the assignment we primarilly used threads spread out in a linear grid (x direction). That's a big improvement over sequential processing, but if the data stretches multiple dimensions, it sometimes makes sense to reflec that in the spatial distribution of threads. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will look at how to use threads and blocks in a 2D grid, what happens when we run out of threads, and how to overcome that without hardcoding. We will also look at the GPU's architecture more in detailm based on which you will establish an optimal thread count during your assignments."

To avoid loosing the overhead data or manually calling the kernel on several parts of the data, striding is used to assign an a single thread to multiple samples of the dataset. Since now a single thread has to loop over several values, striding will also increase the execution time of the kernel. \n",

    "1. Design an image-generating kernel for 1024 px square images using the equation \n",
    "\n",
    "$px[i, j] = (\\sin{\\dfrac{i \\cdot 2.0 \\pi}{T}} + 1.0) \\cdot (\\sin{\\dfrac{j \\cdot 2.0 \\pi}{T}} + 1.0) \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{4}$\n",

    "3. Now use only a quarter of the threads - without striding - and observe the plotted image. What hapens, and what would happen if you had too many threads?\n",
    "4. Overcome the problem using striding - one thread may process multiple pixels.\n",
    "5. Run it again and verify the entire image is rendered. Graphically and in words, how would you describe striding?\n",

    "##### II. Leveraging warps \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate how the kernel behaves when increasing the total number of threads and the amount of threads per block. \n",
    "2. Plot and discuss the dependency of the computational time on the number of threads. Are there any peculiarities and pitfalls one must keep in mind when running a kernel function?\n",
    "3. (optional) Insert the statement `histogram_out_device = cuda.to_device(histogram_out)` before calling the kernel and this time pass it the `histogram_out_device` array. What happens and how is it manifested on the performance?"
