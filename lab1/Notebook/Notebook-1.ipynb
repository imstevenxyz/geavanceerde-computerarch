    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "*This is the first out of three notebooks aimed at introducing you to the core concepts of graphics processing units (GPUs) and walking you through the basics of general-purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to a CPU, a GPU excells in procesing a large number of instructions simultaneously. Its **large amount of processing cores** gives it the ability to execute several thousand, if not million, threads in **parallel**. Using the right tools and correct reasoning during application design, this can yield a greater instruction througput, and decrease the time delay for processing large datasets. Be it images (video frames), elecric signal measurements, or any other domain-specific information.\n",

    "Whether an AMD, ARM, a Qualcomm, or any other GPU can probably be interfaced using OpenGL/OpenCL, this course is structured around Nvidia GPUs and the CUDA API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### CUDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Owing to the efforts made by Nvidia, several open-source communities, and a broad userbase, you can interface Nvidia GPUs through the CUDA API using **a host of programming languages**. All of this makes it easy to start writing and executing parallel code. You can think of the GPU as a step between a CPU and an FPGA - execute lots of instructions in parallel, but you get to stay within the comfort zone of your beloved IDE and programming language.\n",

    "\n",
    "### GeForce GT 730\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using the GeForce GT 730 model, which you verify check by calling `nvidia-smi` in the terminal. It is based on the Kepler architecture and supports compute capability 3.5. Keep this in mind when debugging and looking up the specs of you GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python + Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "Versatile and with lots of available add-ons, Python is growing in popularity accross various sectors, including GPGPU. Being an interpreted language, it's easy to run over and over again, while the **debugging** capabilities of IDEs such as **Pycharm**, and the available **plotting** libraries make it easy to interpret and present the performance of you application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since CUDA was initially intended for C, C++, and Fortran application, we need to fit an **additional compiler** between Python and CUDA. For that purpose we will be using **Numba** - a straightforward Python compiler. It's best to get familiar with it on an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The document you are looking at is called a Jupyter Notebook. It's used for writing and running Python applications from the browser. You can always start a fresh file by clicking `File > New Notebook > Python 3`.\n",
    "It should regularly save you file, but feel free to do so manually every once in a while. \n",
    "\n",
    "Supposing you are running Jupyter Notebooks using Anaconda and the GCA environment, your can also write and run your code from a Notebook, instead of in an IDE (Pycharm), and get the same results."

    "1. Design a kernel function for calculating the DFT of a signal. Start off with the sequential code and accelerate it by omiting one of the *for loops*. Rely on parallel execution instead.\n",
    "2. Call your kernel function and verify its output. Use the same amount of threads as is the number of output frequency components. Start off with a few hundred signal samples. Keep in mind the limit of 1024 threads / block.\n",
    "3. Increase the DFT resolution and with it the number of parallel threads. Does an upper limit exist? If there you can't reach it (long prrocessing times, etc.) then reason about what the limit might be (take a look at the 3.5 compute capability specs on Wikipedia / Nvidia guide).\n",

    "##### II. Timing your code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the supplied timing function to see how fast your code executes and compare it to the performance of the sequential CPU code. Remember to run the kernel at least once before in order for it to compile.\n",
    "2. Increase the DFT resolution and observe the GPU and CPU code processing times. What is the time difference?\n",
    "3. Now adapt your kernel function to run the entire DFT using a single thread on the GPU and observe the difference in processing time. What happens to the execution time?\n",
    "4. For an imput sequence of several hundred samples, execute the DFT on the GPU in a fully sequential manner (single thread), entirelly in parallel, and for a few values in between (a thread needs to loop over several but not all frequency components). Roughly how is the execution time dependent on the number of threads?\n",
    "5. (optional) Add '@numba.jit' before the CPU code's definition and see what happens to the timing results. How does the execution of the CPU code change?\n",
